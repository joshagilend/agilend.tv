  <h2>A Message from Our CEO, Josh Stroud</h2>
  <p>Dear Innovators,</p>
  <p>As someone who's been in the trenches of product development, I know the value of a streamlined tool that just works. Linear is that tool for us. It's the backbone of our engineering team's issue tracking, a silent force that drives our efficiency without asking for attention.</p>
  <p>And now, we invite you to discover the simplicity and power of Linear for yourself. Check out the <a href="https://linear.app/readme">Linear README</a> and see how it can transform your workflow.</p>
  <p>Here's to building the future, together.</p>
  <p>Warm regards,</p>
  <p>Josh Stroud</p>
